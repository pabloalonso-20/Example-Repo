### Strengths and Weaknesses  

I think i am able to walk through coding challenges fairly well.  
I am profiecient in the working with loops, if else, switch statements, and multidimensional arrays. 
My weakness might be explaining about myself and my experience as well as  
remembering how to define abstract concepts. Also confusing the syntax with that of C/C++.
