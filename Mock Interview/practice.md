# Strengths and Weaknesses  

I think i am able to walk through coding challenges fairly well.  
I am profiecient in working with loops, if else, switch statements, and multidimensional arrays. 
Form the video, my weakness might be explaining about myself and my experience,  as well as  
remembering how to define abstract concepts. Also confusing java syntax with that of C/C++.  
  
  
## Questions
### Can you tell me about a project or accomplishment that you are most proud of and why?  
Last semester I took a software engineering course where we were to put all of our knowledge from  
previous coursework into practice, and go through the Software development life cycle. I am proud of this  
because it was a semester long project and I had never done something of this scale, nor had I been in a  
team of 8 developers. We went through designing, and defining the software requirements based on the stake holder's needs. Followed by prototyping, software and usability testing, and finally deployment where we presented our final product to the class.   
  
  
### What does the super() keyword do?
It refers to the parent class objects, which is an example of inheritance. 

### What is an interface and what principle of OOP does it follow?
An interface is an abstract class where you group related methods with empty bodies.
It follows abstraction.
